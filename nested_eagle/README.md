### Overview

There are two folders within this `nested_eagle` directory:

1) `scientific_workflow` will guide you through a whole ML pipeline to create training data, train a model, run inference, and verify a forecast. 
2) `operational_inference` provides scripts to run inference from a checkpoint in near real time. These scripts will assume you have a checkpoint from completing `scientific_workflow` and want to run a near real time forecast with it.
