# Welcome to Eagle!

This repository contains various configurations to guide users through a full machine learning pipeline for weather prediction!

You will find multiple directories showcasing various model configurations ranging from a "hello world" setup to operational quality models.

The key steps to this pipeline include:
1) Data preprocessing using `ufs2arco` to create training, validation, and test datasets
2) Model training using `anemoi-core` modules to train a graph-based model
3) Creating a forecast with `anemoi-inference` to run inference from a model checkpoint
4) Verifying your forecast (or multiple) with `wxvx` to verify against gridded analysis or observervations

Throughout this process you will also use a `eagle-tools` library that provides various utilites for tasks such as executing certain modules or post-processing needs.

For more information about model configurations or the various steps of the pipeline, please see our [documentation](https://epic-eagle.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
