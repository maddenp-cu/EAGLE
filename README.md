# EAGLE

This repository contains configuration and driver code for running an end-to-end machine learning pipeline for weather prediction. The pipeline is orchestrated with `make` targets and `uwtools`-based drivers, and it provisions a self-contained set of conda environments to support each step of the workflow. A typical run follows these steps:

- **Environment setup:** Creates the runtime environments used by each stage of the pipeline.
- **Prepare training and inference data:** Provisions required static assets (e.g., grids and meshes) and produces Zarr-formatted datasets via `ufs2arco`.
- **Train an AI model:** Trains an Anemoi model using the provisioned datasets, producing checkpoints for inference.
- **Generate a forecast:** Runs inference from training checkpoints using `anemoi-inference` to produce forecast output.
- **Prepare output for verification:** Postprocesses forecast output into the formats and directory structure expected by `wxvx`.
- **Verify model performance:** Runs `wxvx` verification against gridded analysis and/or observations, producing MET statistics and plots.
