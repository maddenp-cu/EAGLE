Runtime Environment
=========================

To build the EAGLE runtime virtual environments:

.. code-block:: text

    make env cudascript=<name-or-path> # alternatively: ./setup cudascript=<name-or-path>

This will install Miniforge conda in the current directory and create the various virtual environments.

The value of the ``cudascript=`` argument should be either the name of a file under ``src/cuda/`` (e.g. ``cudascript=ursa``), 
or an arbitrary path to a file (e.g. ``cudascript=/path/to/file``). The file should contain a list of commands that need 
to be executed on the current system to make the CUDA ``nvcc`` program available on ``PATH``. The ``setup`` script uses ``nvcc`` 
to determine the CUDA release number, used to select a matching ``flash-attn`` package. For systems needing no special 
setup to make ``nvcc`` available, ``cudascript=none`` may be specified.

A variety of ``make`` targets are available to execute pipeline steps.

Run ``make`` with no argument to list available targets.
