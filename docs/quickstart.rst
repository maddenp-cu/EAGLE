Quickstart Guide

This section provides a recipe for an end-to-end run of nested-EAGLE on Ursa. As of right now the only supported 
platform is Ursa. Future development will include additional platforms. Stay tuned! 

GNU ``make`` version 3.82 or higher is requred.

Complete the steps below in the ``src/`` directory.

**1. Create all environments**

Run::
    
    make env cudascript=ursa

This step creates the runtime software environment, comprising conda virtual environments to support data prep, 
training, inference, and verification. The ``conda/`` subdirectory it creates is self-contained and can be removed 
and recreated by running the ``make env`` command again, as long as pipeline steps are not currently running.

Developers who will be modifying Python driver code should replace ``make env`` with ``make devenv``, which will 
create the same environments but also install additional code-quality tools for formatting, linting, shellchecking, 
typechecking, and YAML linting.
 
**2. Create the EAGLE YAML config**

Run::
    
    make config compose=base:ursa >eagle.yaml

The ``config`` target operates on ``.yaml`` files in the ``config/`` directory, so this command composes ``config/base.yaml`` 
and ``config/ursa.yaml`` and redirects the composed config into ``eagle.yaml``.

**3. Set the app.base value in eagle.yaml to the absolute path to the current (src/) directory.**

The run directories from subsequent steps, along with the output of those steps, will be created in the ``run/<expname>`` 
subdirectory of ``app.base``, where ``<expname>`` is the value of ``app.experiment_name``.

**4. Create training data**

Run::
    
    make data config=eagle.yaml

This step provisions data required for training and inference. The ``data`` target delegates to targets 
``grids-and-meshes``, ``zarr-gfs``, and ``zarr-hrrr``, which can also be run individually (e.g. ``make grids-and-meshes config=eagle.yaml``), but note that ``grids-and-meshes``, which runs locally, must be run first. The ``zarr-gfs`` and ``zarr-hrrr`` targets can be run in quick succession, as they submit batch jobs: Do not proceed until their batch jobs complete successfully (see the files ``run/<expname>/data/*.out``).

**5. Train the ML model.**

Run::
    
    make training config=eagle.yaml

This step trains a model using data provisioned by the previous step. It submits a batch job: Do not proceed until 
the batch job completes successfully (see the file ``run/<expname>training/runscript.training.out``).

**6. Run inference**

Run::
    
    make inference config=eagle.yaml

This step performs inference, producing a forecast. It submits a batch job: Do not proceed until the batch job 
completes successfully (see the file ``run/<expname>inference/runscript.inference.out``.)

**7. Postprocess model output**

Run:

.. code-block:: text
    
    make prewxvx-global config=eagle.yaml
    make prewxvx-lam config=eagle.yaml

These steps prepare forecast output from the previous step for verification by ``wxvx``. They run locally, so it is 
safe to proceed when the commands return. See the files ``run/<expname>vx/prewxvx/{global,lam}/runscript.prewxvx-*.out`` for details.

**8. Model verification**

Run:

.. code-block:: text
    
    make vx-grid-global config=eagle.yaml
    make vx-grid-lam config=eagle.yaml
    make vx-obs-global config=eagle.yaml
    make vx-obs-lam config=eagle.yaml

These steps perform verification, either of the ``global`` or ``lam`` forecasts, and against gridded analyses (``*-grid-*``) or 
prepbufr observations (``*-obs-*``) as truth. Each submits a batch job, so the four ``make`` commands can be run in quick 
succession to get all the batch jobs running in parallel. When each batch job completes, MET ``.stat`` files and ``.png`` 
plot files can be found under the ``stats/`` and ``plots/`` subdirectories of ``run/<expname>vx/grid2{grid,obs}/{global,lam}/run/``. 
The files ``run/<expname>vx/*.log`` contain the logs from each verification run.
